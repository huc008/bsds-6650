/**
 * Submit your work to Blackboard Assignment 1 as a pdf document. The document should contain:
 *
 * the URL for your git repo. Make sure that the code for the client part 1 and part 2 are in seperate folders in your repo
 * a 1-2 page description of your client design. Include major classes, packages, relationships, whatever you need to convey concisely how your client works.
 * Include Littleâ€™s Law throughput predictions.
 * Client (Part 1) - run your client with 32, 64, 128 and 256 threads, with numSkiers=20000, and numLifts=40.
 * Include the outputs of each run in your submission (showing the wall time) and plot a simple chart showing the wall time by the number of threads.
 * This should be a screen shot of your output window.
 * Client (Part 2) - run the client as per Part 1, showing the output window for each run.
 * Also generate a plot of throughput and mean response time against number of threads.
 * Again, this should be a screen shot of your output window.
